@par Overview
  - Application description
    - This is a reference application to demonstrate the Bluetooth mesh switch and Wi-Fi
      gateway features of the LinkIt 7697 HDK
      through the following:
      - How to use the Bluetooth mesh and Wi-Fi gateway functions.
  - Application features
    - Act as a Wi-Fi station to connect to a Wi-Fi network.
    - Act as a Bluetooth low-energy (LE) device with mesh features. All Bluetooth Mesh Command Line
      Interface (CLI) commands are supported in this project.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - MediaTek LinkIt 7697 HDK
  - HDK switches and pin configuration
    - J36 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, SPI master chip select 0, SPI
      master, and UART1 RX/TX.
    - J35 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, UART2 RX/TX, UART1 RTS/CTS, SPI
      master chip select 1, IR TX, and IR RX.
    - J34 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, UART2 RTS/CTS, I2S, SPI slave,
      and I2C0.
    - J33 provides the pins for GPIOs, PWMs, I2C0, and ADC0~3.
    - J32 provides the pins for GND, 5V, 3.3V, and the reset pin.
    - J25 sets the HDK to either Flash Normal mode or Flash Recovery mode. To
      update the firmware on the LinkIt 7697 HDK:
      - Set the jumper J25 to FLASH Recovery mode. Jumpers J23, J26, J27, 
        and J30 must be on.
      - In this mode, if the power is on, the board loads the ROM code and
        starts the ATE Daemon or Firmware Upgrade Daemon according to the
        MT76x7 Flash Tool's behavior on the PC. To run the project on the
        LinkIt 7697 HDK:
      - Set the jumper J25 off to switch to FLASH Normal mode. Jumpers
        J23, J26, J27, and J30 must be on.
      - In this mode, if the power is on, the board loads the firmware from
        the flash and reboots.
    - There are three buttons on the board:
      - RST - Reset
      - EINT - External interrupt
      - RTC_INT - RTC interrupt
  - Environment configuration
    - A serial tool is necessary for UART logging.
    - COM port settings -baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1, parity:
      none, and flow control: off.

  - Project configuration files using GCC
    - \b GCC/Makefile.:                     GNU Makefile for this project

@par Run the application
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt7697_hdk
    ble_mesh_switch" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to the
    LinkIt 7697 development board.
  - Reboot the HDK. The console shows the "FreeRTOS Running" message to
    indicate that the HDK is booting up.
  - Use '?' and ENTER to query the available command line options. Note that
    the command line options are still under development and subject to
    change without notice.
  - Reference applications run the LinkIt 7697 HDK as a Wi-Fi station and acts as a provisioner to 
    add other mesh devices to the mesh network via Bluetooth LE.
  - Example 1. Wi-Fi station mode
    - Find your Wi-Fi access point settings: Before connecting to a Wi-Fi
      access point, the following information must be collected: 1. The
      SSID of your Wi-Fi access point. 2. The authentication mode of your Wi-
      Fi access point. The authentication mode is usualy WPA PSK or WPA2
      PSK. To change the mode, please refer to Table 1 for the list of
      supported authentication modes. 3. The password of your Wi-Fi access
      point. 4. The encryption mode of your Wi-Fi access point(
      AES or TKIP is usually used). To change the mode, please refer to Table 2 for
      the list of supported encryption modes.
    - When the information is collected, use the following commands to
      configure the LinkIt 7697 HDK. The example code in main.c assumes that
      either WPA PSK or WPA2 PSK is used for authentication, TKIP or AES is 
      used for encryption, 'myhome' (length 6) is used for the SSID, and the
      WPA or WPA2 password is '12345678' (length 8).
      \code
      config write STA AuthMode 9
      config write STA EncrypType 8
      config write STA Ssid myhome
      config write STA SsidLen 6
      config write STA WpaPsk 12345678
      config write STA WpaPskLen 8
      config write common OpMode 1
      \endcode press the RESET button on the LinkIt 7697 HDK to restart the system.
    - Boot up with the new configuration. If everything is correct, the same
      messages are shown in the console to tell you that the HDK has received
      an IP address.
      \code
      ************************
      DHCP got IP:10.10.10.101
      ************************
      \endcode
    - PING from the LinkIt 7697 HDK (SDK v3.1.0) If the IP address is fetched
      and the network is operating, LinkIt 7697 can ping other devices on
      the network with the following command in the console.
      \code
      f 11 10.10.10.254 3 64
      \endcode The ping stops after sending three packets to 10.10.10.254. The ping usage is: f 11 \<ip address\> \<times\> \<ping packet length\>
    - Wi-Fi configuration options for AuthMode and EncrypType.

  - Example 2. Using the BLE mesh feature
    - This example creates a BLE mesh device with one mesh element. In this element, there are four models: 
      configuration server model; health server model; generic on/off client 
      model; and configuration client model.
    - The mesh feature is enabled after Bluetooth successfully powers on.
      A similar log is written to the output:
      \code
      [T: xxxx M: mesh_app C: info F: bt_mesh_app_event_callback L: 272]: BLE_MESH_EVT_INIT_DONE
      \endcode
    - It supports PB-ADV and PB-GATT bearers to provision a device to a network.
      - PB-ADV Provision
	    - Input the command "mesh config addr [device address]" on the serial
	      tool to assign the address for the primary mesh element. For example, 
	      "mesh config addr 0001".
	    - Input the command "mesh key add net [netkey] [netkey index]" on the serial
	      tool to add the netkey to the mesh stack. This is used when creating a network.
	      - netkey, a random number with 16 bytes.
	      - netkey index, assign an index for the above netkey, starting at 0.
	      - For example, "mesh key add net 12345678901234567890123456789012 0".

	      - appkey index, is 0x123 currently in this project.
	      - netkey index, same as the one above.
	      - For example, "mesh key add app 63964771734fbd76e3b40519d1d94a48 0x123 0".
	    - Input the command "mesh config bind" on the serial
	      tool to bind the vendor model/config model with app key index "0x123".    
	    - Create a network
	      Input the command "mesh prov run [remote device UUID] [netkey] [netkey index] [ivindex] [address] [flags]" on the serial
	      tool to add the specific mesh device to the mesh network.
	      - device UUID of vendor device, 16-bytes.
	      - netkey, the same netkey when input "mesh key add net".
	      - netkey index, the same netkey when input "mesh key add net".
	      - ivindex, usually use 0.
	      - address, 2 bytes, the address assigned to the specific mesh device when it is successfully added to the network.
	      - flags, indicate current states of IV update and key refresh. Usually use 0.
	      - For example "mesh prov run 04112233445566778899aabbccddeeff 12345678901234567890123456789012 0 0 0004 0".

	    - Input the command "mesh key add net [netkey] [netkey index]" on the serial
	      tool to add the netkey to the mesh stack. This is used when creating a 
	      network.
	      - netkey, random number with 16 bytes.
	      - netkey index, assign an index for the above netkey, starting at 0.
	      - For example, "mesh key add net 12345678901234567890123456789012 0".
	    - Input the command "mesh key add app [appkey] [appkey index] [netkey index]" on the serial
	      tool to add the app key to the mesh stack. 
	      - appkey, random number with 16 bytes.
	      - appkey index, is currently 0x123 in this project.
	      - netkey index, same as the one above.
	      - for example, "mesh key add app 63964771734fbd76e3b40519d1d94a48 0x123 0".
	    - Input the command "mesh config bind" in the serial
	      tool to bind the vendor model/config model with app key index "0x123".    
	    - Create a network.
	      - Firstly, input the command "mesh prov init [netkey] [netkey index] [ivindex] [address] [flags]" on the serial
	        tool to add the specific mesh device to the mesh network.
   	        - netkey, the same netkey when input "mesh key add net".
   	        - netkey index, the same netkey when input "mesh key add net".
   	        - ivindex, usually use 0.
   	        - address, 2 bytes, the address assigned to the specific mesh device when it is successfully added to the network.
   	        - flags, indicate current states of IV update and key refresh. Usually use 0.
   	        - For example "mesh prov init 12345678901234567890123456789012 0 0 0014 0".
   	      - Then, input the command "mesh gatt connect [addr type] [remote bluetooth addr] [service type]" on the serial
	        tool to create a Mesh GATT connection.
   	        - addr type, the address type of [remote bluetooth addr]. 0 = a public address, 1 = a random address.
   	        - remote bluetooth addr, the Bluetooth address of the remote device when advertising.
   	        - service type, 0 means proxy, 1 means provision.
   	        - For example, "mesh gatt connect 0 C6:29:AB:B7:48:25 1".
      - When the provisioning is complete, the log shows "BLE_MESH_EVT_PROV_DONE" SUCCESS or FAILED.
      - Then, some configuration processes will automatically run, incluing Get composition data, Add appkey, and Model Application 
        binding. When the configuration is complete, the log shows "no more model, all model binding is done"
	  - When the above procedure is complete, the provision and configuration processes are done, then we can test the detail features by sending messages on the serial
	    tool. For example, input the command "mesh msg onoff set [dst_addr] [onoff] [reliable] [ttl]" to use advertising to turn on/off each light with 
	    a target address.
	    - dst_addr, is the destination address.
	    - OnOff, the target value if it is in the Generic OnOff state.
	    - reliable, is to send the request as an acknowledged message or not.
	    - ttl, is the received TTL value.
	    - For example, send "mesh msg onoff set 0014 1 1 5".
	  - For more information about other commands, please refer to the cmds[] structure in mesh_app_switch.c file.
  - Example 3. Using the BLE mesh/wifi gateway feature
    - This example allows the LinkIt 7697 HDK to act as a gateway to send the Wi-Fi data to a BLE mesh device.
    - With the procedure in the Example 1, the LinkIt 7697 HDK is connected to the laptop via WI-FI and has an IP address.
    - Connect the laptop to the LinkIt 7697 HDK via Telnet.
      Use the Telnet protocol with port 23 to connect to the IP address of the LinkIt 7697 HDK.
    - Then Input the commands in Example 2 to complete the network configuration and creation.
